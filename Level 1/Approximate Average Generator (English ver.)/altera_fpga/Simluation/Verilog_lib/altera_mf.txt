Quartus II 4.1 
1. Added additional support for Cyclone II for 
   - altsyncram, altmult_add, altmult_accum & altpll
2. dcfifo 
   - Added support for 'showahead speed' mode and 'showahead area' mode.
3. altmult_add, altmult_accum
   - Added support for 18 bit inputs when saturation and rounding feature are used.
4. altlvds_rx, altlvds_tx
   - Fixed simulation halt issue under x1 mode and x2 mode when inclock period is set to 0.
   - Added support for -180 degrees phase shift on PLL serial clock.
5. altpll
   - Added support to handle the large clk*multiply_by and clk*divide_by numbers.

Notes:
-	ModelSim 5.8 gives the following warning when altera_mf or 220models 
    Megafunction models are compiled using -87 switch
    >> # ** Warning: (vcom-1148) Condition in IF GENERATE must be static. <<
    -> This warning can be safely ignored because under the 1987 rules, 
       the constant is not considered to be static because of the initialization from the function call.
-	RAM Megafunction models only support HEX format for all 3rd party simulators. 
    Workaround: to manually convert MIF format to HEX first under Quartus II.
